# todo-app

A simple to-do app for the Odin Project. I used webpack to compile the javascript files and tried to divide functions logically between the different files using import/export. The projects and todo items are stored in localstorage and will automatically reload from the same computer where they were originally entered. 

The more details button and new project button bring up simple popups. In the details popup I formatted the date using date.fns, just for practice. 

This was definitely the biggest challenge yet, but I feel pretty good about the results overall! I could definitely spend more time making it look nicer, but that was not my main goal with this one.
